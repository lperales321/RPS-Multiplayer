# RPS-Multiplayer
Rock-Paper-Scissors Multiplayer Game

Enter your name to join the game. Only when two players have signed up, will the buttons be enabled.

Player 1 goes first and clicks either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Their selection is written to Firebase.
Then Player 2 makes their selection. Both selections are compared and the scores for number of wins, losses and ties are updated.
The scores are stored in Firebase.

Note:
There are a couple of things I wanted to add but ran out of time.
I want to add a timer so that the Winner message is displayed for longer.
Also, I want to delete the objects from Firebase on a restart.
Finally, I wanted to make it look a lot nicer so that it matches my portfolio theme.
I will be adding these things later.
